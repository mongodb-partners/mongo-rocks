# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Make sure you add unittests/cpptests for what you write, although not forced. Unfortunaly, it's impossible to add more resmoke tests/js tests because they are in mongodb's code base.
3. It is encouraged to make pull request to the **master** branch, which tracks the latest develop activities. Pull requests to other branchs are only limited to bug fixes.

## Code of Conduct

### Code Standards

MongoRocks follows mongodb's code-style. Which is similiar with google-c++-code-style. It's highly suggested you **clang-format** your code before making the pull request. It's not forced but advised.
